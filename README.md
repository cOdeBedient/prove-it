# Prove It!

**Overview:**
*Prove it!* Is a silly, mobile-designed app that uses OpenAi to generate a fake google page to settle friendly arguments.

## Description
You and a friend are watching the olympics and arguing about how tall Lebron James is. You think he's under 6'11". You're friend thinks he is 7'2". You pull out your phone to "Google" it, and it just so happens that the Google Ai generated answer EXACTLY confirms what you thought to be true. You turn your phone to your friend who sees you are in fact correct and backs down from his earlier conviction.<br></br>
This app is a silly way to show that a specific piece of data is true.

## Challenges
- Working with OpenAi to get consistent responses.
- Styling for a mobile-first development process. 

## Wins
- Learned and implemented Tailwind CSS for more direct element styling.
- Designed a training prompt and establushed OpenAi calls to return specifically crafted responses based on user inputs.

## Up Next 
I plan to explore React Native, porting the app into that development environment and learning some of the techniques for store-ready applications.
